PERSONALITY TRAIT INSIGHTS
----------------------------------------
Most Predictive Traits:
  • neuroticism: 78.1% significance rate
  • conscientiousness: 59.4% significance rate
  • agreeableness: 53.1% significance rate

Cross-Scenario Patterns:
  • neuroticism: Moral ← (-0.157), Risk → (0.257)
  • conscientiousness: Moral → (0.228), Risk ← (-0.075)
  • agreeableness: Moral → (0.032), Risk ← (-0.071)
  • openness: Moral ← (-0.051), Risk ← (-0.234)
  • extraversion: Moral ← (-0.010), Risk ← (-0.461)

KEY FINDINGS
----------------------------------------
• Total significant AI model associations: 501/960 (52.2%)
• Best performing model: gpt-4o (overall score: 0.540)
• Most predictive personality trait: neuroticism (78.1% significance)

DATA SOURCES
----------------------------------------
• Regression results: study_4_generalized_analysis_results/complete_regression_results.csv
• Human baseline: Included in regression results as 'human_baseline' format
• AI models: gpt-4, gpt-4o, llama, deepseek across all formats

RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
• Use gpt-4o for future behavioral personality simulations
• Models show similar performance - ensemble approaches may be beneficial

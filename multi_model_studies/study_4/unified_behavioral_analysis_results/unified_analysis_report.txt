PERSONALITY TRAIT INSIGHTS:
----------------------------------------
Most Predictive Traits:
  • neuroticism: 78.1% significance rate
  • conscientiousness: 59.4% significance rate
  • agreeableness: 53.1% significance rate

Cross-Scenario Patterns:
  • neuroticism: Moral ← (-0.157), Risk → (0.257)
  • conscientiousness: Moral → (0.228), Risk ← (-0.075)
  • agreeableness: Moral → (0.032), Risk ← (-0.071)
  • openness: Moral ← (-0.051), Risk ← (-0.234)
  • extraversion: Moral ← (-0.010), Risk ← (-0.461)

KEY FINDINGS:
----------------------------------------
• Total significant associations found: 496/960 (51.7%)
• Best performing model: gpt-4o (overall score: 0.540)
• Most predictive personality trait: neuroticism (78.1% significance)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------
• Use gpt-4o for future behavioral personality simulations
• Models show similar performance - ensemble approaches may be beneficial

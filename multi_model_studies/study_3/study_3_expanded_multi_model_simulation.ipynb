        "This notebook implements Study 3's BFI-2 to Mini-Marker simulation using **Expanded format** personality descriptions across multiple LLM models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Study 3 Overview\n",
        "Study 3 has three main components:\n",
        "1. **Statistical Simulation**: Extract parameters from Soto's study and simulate new dataset (completed by `bfi2_facet_level_parameter_extraction_and_simulation.py`)\n",
        "2. **LLM Simulation**: Use simulated personality data to generate Mini-Marker responses across multiple models\n",
        "3. **Analysis**: Compare results across models and formats\n",
        "\n",
        "## Models to Test\n",
        "- GPT-3.5-Turbo\n",
        "- GPT-4\n",
        "- GPT-4o  \n",

        "\n",
        "## Data Flow\n",
        "1. Load statistically simulated BFI-2 data (from `facet_lvl_simulated_data.csv`)\n",
        "2. Map numeric responses to **Expanded format** descriptions\n",
        "3. Generate personality simulation prompts\n",
        "4. Run simulations across multiple models with enhanced validation\n",
        "5. Save results for analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "- Uses statistically simulated data (not empirical Soto data)\n",
        "- Expanded-style personality descriptions (\"You are very...\")\n",
        "- Parallel multi-model execution\n",
        "- Enhanced validation and retry logic\n",
        "- Comprehensive error handling\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Difference from Likert Format\n",
        "- **No reverse coding needed**: The simulated data is already in the correct format\n",
        "- Uses `expanded_scale` mapping instead of `likert_scale`\n",
        "- Uses `get_expanded_prompt` instead of `get_likert_prompt`\n"

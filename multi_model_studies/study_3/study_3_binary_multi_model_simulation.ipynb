    "# Study 3 Multi-Model Personality Simulation (Binary Baseline Format)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements Study 3's BFI-2 to Mini-Marker simulation using **Binary baseline format** personality descriptions across multiple LLM models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study 3 Overview\n",
    "Study 3 has three main components:\n",
    "1. **Statistical Simulation**: Extract parameters from Soto's study and simulate new dataset (completed by `bfi2_facet_level_parameter_extraction_and_simulation.py`)\n",
    "2. **LLM Simulation**: Use simulated personality data to generate Mini-Marker responses across multiple models\n",
    "3. **Analysis**: Compare results across models and formats\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models to Test\n",
    "- GPT-3.5-Turbo\n",
    "- GPT-4\n",
    "- GPT-4o  \n",
    "- Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\n",
    "- DeepSeek-V3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Flow\n",
    "1. Load statistically simulated BFI-2 data (from `facet_lvl_simulated_data.csv`)\n",
    "2. Convert BFI-2 domain scores to **Binary baseline format** descriptions\n",
    "3. Generate personality simulation prompts\n",
    "4. Run simulations across multiple models with enhanced validation\n",
    "5. Save results for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- Uses statistically simulated data (not empirical Soto data)\n",
    "- Binary baseline personality descriptions (\"You are high/low in...\")\n",
    "- Parallel multi-model execution\n",
    "- Enhanced validation and retry logic\n",
    "- Comprehensive error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences from Expanded/Likert Formats\n",
    "- **Simplified descriptions**: Uses only high/low classifications for each Big Five domain\n",
    "- **Threshold-based**: Converts continuous scores to binary (high/low) using 2.5 threshold\n",
    "- **Baseline comparison**: Serves as a simple baseline to compare against more complex formats\n",
    "- Uses `get_binary_prompt` instead of `get_expanded_prompt` or `get_likert_prompt`\n"
